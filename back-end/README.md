# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

File structure

- api : main yaml file to generate the api
- controllers : handle requests
- db : db_connection + set_up
- service : our business logic
- utils : handle responses

## set-up / requirements

**NOT RECOMMENDED PLEASE USE THE DOCKER DEPLOYMENT EXPLAIN IN THE MAIN README**

- node / npm
- sql server (could MAMP, WAMP, LAMP..)
  - All database configuration is done with env variables
  - **Auto-setup** : run the bash script with `eval "$(.db/set_env.bash)"`
  - **Manual-setup** : set `SR05_DB_HOST`, `SR05_DB_USER`, `SR05_DB_PASS`,`SR05_DB_PORT`,`SR05_DB_DATABASE`
- Do the migrations with the sql file in `db/sql.sql`

### Running the server

```
npm start
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
